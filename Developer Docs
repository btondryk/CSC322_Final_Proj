Start up/boot up: The Raspberry Pi runs a cron job at reboot that runs a python script. If the cron job is terminated, the script will not run.
Load Starting Image: Once the Raspberry Pi, reboots, the python script is accessed and will display a starting image to signify that the Raspberry Pi is running the correct script. Along with loading the starting image, the script imports libraries and provides paths to the images directory. It will also pass in the wiring to the main function.
Check Limit Switch: If the limit switch is pressed, the press will call a method "dislay_random_image". The method will first randomly choose one of the 28 images. Then the script will open the random image, and orient it on the disk with a 180 degree rotation. 
Check Limit Switch: If the limit switch is not pressed the Raspberry Pi will meremly wait till it is pressed - staying on the current image.
Continue to change images via limit switch until the cronjob stops, the Raspberry Pi is powered down, or the user enters ctrl +c when the Raspberry Pi is hooked up to monitor and keyboard.
