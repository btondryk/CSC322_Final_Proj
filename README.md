# CSC322_Final_Proj
This code is stored on the raspberry pi and its purpose is to be compatible with a nerf gun that my group and I are creating. When the user of the gun clicks the trigger, the trigger will hit a limit switch - signaling the raspberry pi to display a wide array of images on its circular 1.28 inch lcd screen. These images range from simple onomatopoeias like "Bang" or "Pop" to more complex images. The code is run upon bootup using a cronjob and will always display a disclaimer message to both warn the user of its potential dangers and indicate it is ready to go.
