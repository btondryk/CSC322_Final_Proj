# CSC322_Final_Proj
This code is stored on the raspberry pi and its purpose is to be compatible with a nerf gun that my group and I are creating. When the user of the gun clicks the trigger the raspberry pi will display a wide array of images on its circular lcd display. These images range from simple onomatopoeias like "Bang" or "Pop" to more complex images.
